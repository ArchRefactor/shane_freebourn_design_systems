# Shane Freebourn, RA, NCARB 
### Licensed Architect | Systems Optimizer | Product-Minded Designer

Welcome to my professional systems portfolio. I view architectural design and business operations through the lens of **scalable logic**. This repository demonstrates my ability to bridge the gap between traditional architectural licensure and the technical requirements of the ConTech/PropTech industry.
