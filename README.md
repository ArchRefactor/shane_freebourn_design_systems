## 🚀 Executive Summary: The "Systems" Approach
Welcome to my professional systems portfolio. I view architectural design and business operations through the lens of **scalable logic**. My career is defined by a transition from traditional architectural design to **"Product-Minded" systems architecture**, bridging the gap between licensure and the technical requirements of the ConTech industry.

## 🏗️ Core Competencies
* **Residential Productization:** Transitioning one-off custom designs into repeatable, high-efficiency home families.
* **BIM Automation:** Expert-level Revit leadership with a focus on increasing production velocity through standardized logic.
* **Data-Driven Configuration:** Utilizing tools (Excel/Power Query) to automate complex decision-making in the sales and design lifecycle.
* **Regulatory Navigation:** Successfully managing multi-state CD sets and complex jurisdictional "red tape" at scale.
