# Lot Fit Checker: Sales Configuration Prototype

## The Problem
Manual lot-fit analysis was a bottleneck in the pre-sales process. Sales teams lacked a real-time method to verify if specific home models and optional add-ons (like sunrooms or garage extensions) would physically fit within the buildable area of a specific lot.

## The Solution
I engineered this lookup-based validation tool using Excel logic. It allows a user to select a Lot Number and a Base Model, then toggles specific options to receive an instant "Pass/Fail" (Green/Red) status based on site-specific setbacks and easements.

## Higharc Relevance: "Systematizing Flexibility"
This tool demonstrates my ability to:
* **Translate Code to Logic:** Converting complex setback requirements into binary "Yes/No" parameters.
* **Product-Minded Design:** Creating a user-friendly interface for non-technical team members.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Reducing the technical validation cycle from days to seconds.
